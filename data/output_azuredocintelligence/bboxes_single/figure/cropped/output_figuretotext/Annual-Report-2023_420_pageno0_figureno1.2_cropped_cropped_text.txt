3. **Detailed Description:**
   The figure is a stacked bar chart displaying the compensation breakdown for three different scenarios: Full Year 2023, Target Compensation, and Maximum Compensation. Each bar is divided into three segments representing different types of compensation: Base Salary (dark blue), STA (light blue), and LTA (sky blue). The total compensation values are displayed at the top of each bar.

6. **Overall Theme or Message:**
   The chart conveys the breakdown and comparison of different compensation packages for a specific position or role over the full year 2023, target compensation, and maximum compensation scenarios. The emphasis is on illustrating how each component (Base Salary, STA, and LTA) contributes to the total compensation.

7. **Other Relevant Details or Observations:**
   - The Base Salary remains constant at 3,600 across all three compensation scenarios.
   - The STA and LTA components vary across the scenarios, contributing to the differences in total compensation.
   - The Maximum Compensation scenario has the highest total compensation at 9,850, followed by Target Compensation at 9,225, and Full Year 2023 at 8,745.
   - The color-coding helps in distinguishing the different components of the compensation clearly.
